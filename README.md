# Fortuneâ€™s Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fortune  Egbai. Iâ€™m a business and product analyst driven by curiosity and empathy for users. I love translating numbers and stories into insights that shape smarter products and real business impact.

My journey blends data analysis, customer research, sales, and hands-on customer service, giving me a front-row seat to how people think, feel, and decide. I believe great products start with understanding real human needs, and delivering solutions that truly fit.

In this portfolio, youâ€™ll see how I connect the dots between business strategy, user behavior, and product thinking to solve practical problems and create better experiences for people.
